Lonely
Song by Koffee


Where the bassline? Up inna the daytime
Had a late night, but I never laid down
I never stay down
I hope your day's fine
We should spend the day now, ayy
I'm gonna make time
So you should make time
And we should play
I have 'nuff things to say, I
Let's run away, we can take a vacation
Treasure creation, okay, ayy
We'll go from land to sea, yeah
This ain't no fantasy, darling
Do anything you wan' do
Let me take your worries off you
Stay right here next to me, yeah
You're in good company, darling
Go anywhere you wan' go
Better come back tomorrow, because
I know it's hard to trust sometimes
But it's harder to be lonely, yeah
So would you rather to be lonely? Yeah (would you rather to be)
No way
I know you're scared to give your heart
But you gotta get to know me, yeah
I said you gotta get to know me, yeah
Inna the place
Drive up inna the Benz, yeah
Deh 'pon di ends
Vibes up you and your friends, yeah
All dem ah chat

You know I've got the time, yeah
I know I'm on your mind, darling
When are you gon' come my way?
And are we gon' get to play?
It ain't, uh, worth denying, yeah
This was, hmm, pre-designed, darling
I don't know what else to say
This must be our destiny
I know it's hard to trust sometimes
But it's harder to be lonely, yeah
So would you rather to be lonely? Yeah (would you rather to be)
No way
I know you're scared to give your heart
But you gotta get to know me, yeah
I said you gotta get to know me, yeah
From the other day, you take a liking to me, yeah
Now ah me you're liking to see, okay
Where me deh ah, deh you likely fi be, yeah
You prefer Koffee, you nuh like cerasee tea, uh-huh
Even though you might blend the tree
Me up in the mug, the other side sensimilia
Can handle you 'cause I ain't no licensee
Plus your body shot, you need a license to be, yeah
I know it's hard to trust sometimes
But it's harder to be lonely, yeah
Now would you rather to be lonely? Yeah (would you rather to be)
No way
I know you're scared to give your heart
But you gotta get to know me, yeah
So do you wanna get to know me? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Listen me, Koffee the visionary
Picture me visually, get a picture delivery
You know seh me crisp from me mommy did Christen me
And then me full up ah precision, that's why you fi prefer me
And when you look upon me wrist and me pocket you see money
And then me run out 'pon the street, wake the town, tell everybody

Do this for my brother, my granny and my mommy
Whoa, darlin' (whoa, darlin')
