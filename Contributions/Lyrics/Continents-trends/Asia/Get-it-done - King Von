Get It Done
Song by King Von and OMB Peezy

Lyrics


That you the only one
We doin' m- one
We gon' get it done
(DJ on the beat, so it's a banger)
Hope you don't think that you the only one (you the only one)
Ridin' 'round this b- we doin' m- one (we doin' m- one)
Me and Peezy, we gon' get it done (we gon' get it done)
Jump a n- a- ain't no one-on-ones (ain't no one-on-ones, nah, look)
Hope you don't think that you the only one? (You the only one)
Ridin' 'round this b- we doin' m- one (we doin' m- one)
Ayy, me and Von, we gon' get it done (we gon' get it done)
Look, jump a n- a- ain't no one-on-ones (Von)
Better think fast, n- (fast)
I got a bag, I'm on your ass, you done made me mad, n- (you made me mad)
And if your homie wanna ride, he can go out sad with you (go out sad)
I'm Picasso with the block, I paint a bad picture (boom, boom, boom, boom)
How you gangster and your b- a- got f- with you? (You got f- with you)
You started rappin' and got k- now they mad at you (now they mad at you)
I tote them drums with that bass like the band with me (boom, boom)
And sit your b- a- down if you ain't gon' stand with me (sit your b- a- down)
Boy, I got bands with me, AK's, FN's with me (FN's)
Doin' hits alone, I don't need my mans with me (need my mans)
I put that D- to your face if you playin' silly (If you playin', huh?)
And it's a lot of n- dead 'cause they was playin' with me (grrah, grrah)
Hope you don't think that you the only one? (You the only one)
Ridin' 'round this b- we doin' m- one (we doin' m- one)
Me and Peezy, we gon' get it done (we gon' get it done)
Jump a n- a- ain't no one-on-ones (ain't no one-on-ones, nah, look)
Hope you don't think that you the only one? (You the only one)
Ridin' 'round this b- we doin' m- one (we doin' m- one)
Ayy, me and Von, we gon' get it done (we gon' get it done)
Look, jump a n- a- ain't no one-on-ones
Ayy, ain't no one-on-one
He just got a G- think he the only one (only one)
He was on the block until he got popped with a stolen g-
He came home but he can't leave the house, he sold his soul for nothin'
Ayy, watch out for that lil' n- Peezy, he'll f- over somethin' (for real)
Get it done, bust a n- head for that cheddar (cheddar)
Don't give a f- if you feel me, play with that bread, then it's whatever (whatever)
Found out he fakin' now he fold up like some paper, we gon' shred him
I'm living better, brand new Mazi, finna w- it with a sweater
Ain't gotta tell a n- stop with all that talkin' on the phone
Maybe snitching, n- you can do that shit there on your own
Can't sleep, can't eat, when it's beef, I get 'em gone
Gon' beat a f- n- to sleep up in this b- better watch your tone
B- it's Peezy
Hope you don't think that you the only one? (You the only one)
Ridin' 'round this b- we doin' m- one (we doin' m- one)
Me and Peezy, we gon' get it done (we gon' get it done)
Jump a n- a- ain't no one-on-ones (ain't no one-on-ones, nah, look)
Hope you don't think that you the only one? (You the only one)
Ridin' 'round this b- we doin' m- one (we doin' m- one)
Ayy, me and Von, we gon' get it done (we gon' get it done)
Look, jump a n- a- ain't no one-on-ones
That you the only one
We doin' m- one
We gon' get it done
You the only one
We doin' m- one
We gon' get it done
You the only one
