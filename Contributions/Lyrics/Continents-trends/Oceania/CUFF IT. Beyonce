CUFF IT
Song by BeyonceÃÅ

Lyrics


I feel like fallin' in love (fallin' love)
I'm in the mood to fuck something up (tonight, I'm fucking something up, baby)
I need some drink in my cup (I need a drink)
Hey (pour me a drink)
I'm in the mood to fuck something up (I'm in the mood to fuck something up)
I wanna go missing
I need a prescription
I wanna go higher, can I sit on top of you? (Ou la-lala, lala)
I wanna go where nobody's been (wanna go where nobody's been)
Have you ever had fun like this? (Have you ever had fun?)
We gon' fuck up the night, black lights
Spaceships fly (spaceships fly)
Yeah, unapologetic when we fuck up the night
Fuck up the night
We getting fucked up tonight
We gon' fuck up the night
Bet you you'll see far
Bet you you'll see stars
Bet you you'll elevate
Bet you you'll meet God
'Cause I feel like fallin' in love
I'm in the mood to fuck something up
'Cause we gon' fuck up the night
What's in these four walls?
You sexy, my love (turn it up)
Don't miss this roll-call
Is you here or what? (Roll it up)
Yeah, show up, show up (show up, show up)
Po' up, po' up (po' up, po' up)
Uh, you Mister Nasty, I'll clean it up
Go where nobody's been (wanna go where nobody's been)
Have you ever had fun like this? (Have you ever had fun?)
I wanna go missing
I need a prescription
I wanna go higher, can I sit on top of you?
We gon' fuck up the night (funk it up, funk it up)
Black lights
Spaceships fly (spaceships fly)
Yeah, unapologetic when we fuck up the night (funk it up, funk it up)
Fuck up tonight
We getting fucked up tonight
We gon' fuck up the night
Bet you you'll see far
Bet you you'll see stars
Bet you you'll elevate
Bet you you'll meet God
'Cause I feel like fallin' in love
I'm in the mood to fuck something up
We gon' fuck up the night
Hypersonic, sex erotic
On my body, boy, you got it
Hit them 'draulics, while I ride it
Got me actin' hella thotty
So excited, so exotic
I'm a seasoned professional
Squeeze it, don't let it go
Tease it, no self control
I got time today (I got time today, I got time)
Oh, I (I got time today, I got time)
I can't wait 'to come out and play
Ooh, yeah you
Come and cuff it, cuff it, cuff it, cuff it, baby
While I buss it, buss it, buss it, for you baby, ayy
Ooh, baby
Anywhere, any time, I don't mind, I don't mind
I don't mind (for you)
Boy, for you
I'm backin' the truck up (back that truck up, boy)
For you (all for you, for you)
A bitch'll get fucked up (I fuck you up)
For you (all for you)
I'm puttin' my cup up (put my cup up, yeah)
For you
We gon' fuck up the night
Take flight
Blindin' lights, yeah
(Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up)
(Unapologetic when we fuck up the night)
Bet you you'll see stars
Bet you you'll go far
Bet you you'll levitate
Bet you you'll meet God
Party people, roll up (ooh)
Yeah, huh (we gon' fuck up the night)
Spaceships fly
Fuck it up, fuck it up
