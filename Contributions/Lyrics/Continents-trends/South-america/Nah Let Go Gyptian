Nah Let Go
Song by Gyptian

Lyrics


Nah let go, no
Nah let go, no
Ooh yeah lemme sing
Said I want I want you
Said I want to I want to
I'll give you some time
Even a little wine
She say she nah let go
No matter how far meh go
She say she rather be there so
And she nah mek no joke
She say she nah let go
No matter how far meh go
She say she rather be there so
And she nah run no joke
Tell me how you bend and move like an acrobat
When how tell me how you do that
Babe I never seen you move like a gymnastic
And your moves are fine and fantastic
Random girl your body is incredible
Spin on my hole like a turn table
You turn suh and give me the drop and wine
And you open up my eyes wide one more time
Nah let go
No matter how far meh go
She say she rather be there so
And she nah mek no joke
She say she nah let go
No matter how far meh go
She say she rather be there so
And she nah run no joke
Like a hundred degrees clock
Wine like that, girl baby wine and stop
Wonder where get style like that
Me you tell em meh nah wan see you stop girl
Get shape like beer bottle
Hold a bottle shape leh yuh beer stable
Nough gyal out around like you
But them wudda had instead me a follow you
Nah let go
No matter how far meh go
She say she rather be there so
And she nah mek no joke
She say she nah let go
No matter how far meh go
She say she rather be there so
And she nah run no joke
I've never ever seen another girl wine this way
And don't you even bother to get her number
Because the sexy girl is with me
Nah let go
No matter how far meh go
She say she rather be there so
And she nah mek no joke
She say she nah let go
No matter how far meh go
She say she rather be there so
And she nah run no joke
Nah let go
No matter how far meh go
She say she rather be there so
And she nah mek no joke
She say nah let go
No matter how far meh go
She say she rather be there so
And she nah run no joke, nah, nah, nah
