Lyrics


Organize
Every other day I organize
Yeah, oh
Organize
Every other day I organize
Some of us are wise
Every other person over wise (mmh)
O logbon ju, o gbon, o gbon, o gbon
Iwo lo gbon ju
Agbogbon ju, ogbon, ama molo gbon go
Oti logbon ju
Based on one or two polopolo
Eyan kogbagidi opolopo, hmm
O da ko jen simi, shemi je'olohun
Emi yato sawon, kan ka mi soto, ka mi soto
Ojogor jogor, e gba logo logo logo, to'ba fuck up
See tonight for the club we go turn up
Everybody ready pop, ibi pogan, ibi pogan
Gbagbe oshi (ey, ey), awa nikan ni kososhi (ey, ey)
I no go let anyone control
Anything wey I wan do, I go do
Gbagbe oshi (ey, ey), awa nikan ni kososhi (ey, ey)
I no go let anyone control
Anything wey I wan do, I go do
Organize
Every other day I organize
Some of us are wise
Every other person over wise (mmh)
O logbon ju, o gbon, o gbon, o gbon
Iwo lo gbon ju (ogbon, sodiki)
Agbogbon ju, ogbon, ama molo gbon go
Oti logbon ju
