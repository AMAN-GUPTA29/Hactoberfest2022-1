Fortified (fuego)


My nigga this shit divine ('vine)
I said it, I did it, no lie (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Everything checked no decline (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Nobody fit tell me how this shit goes (goes)
If I fail, I needed that I'll come back stronger
I love to learn that way that's how I grow (grow, grow, grow)
A tough skin, that's the trauma child code
Easy, brrt, go easy
Spend a lotta time on your self
I don't care about me no more
I'm only bout survival
Easy, brrt, go easy
Spend a lotta time on your self
I don't care about me no more
Sɛ meyɛ aa na mewu aa na meko
Sɛ meyɛ aa na mewu aa na meko
Sɛ meyɛ aa na mewu aa na meko
Sɛ meyɛ aa na mewu aa na meko
Sɛ meyɛ aa na mewu aa na meko
Kwaku Rasta eh, trapping my way up
Doing this shit my way
I really don't fuck with pagans
Nny3 sikas3m dea later
Told you guys s3 menfri ha
Four hours drive to my homeland
I learned this shit the hard way, man
Slwhy I move like a jail man
Scars on my face mabr3 o jack
Jigga dem lied on my name
I couldn't do shit 'bout it
Nti na daadaa you go see me then I frustrate
Oh, my days
Which kind world be this?
Jigga dem lied on my name
And I couldn't do shit 'bout it
Dem dey take my bread from my mouth
They no want make jigga eat (make jigga eat)
Oh, my days (oh)
Which kind world be this? (Oh)
Oh, I say (I say)
Easy bro go easy
Spend a lotta time on your self
I don't care about me no more
I'm only bout survival
Easy brrr go easy
Spend a lotta time on your self
I don't care about me no more
Sɛ meyɛ aa na mewu aa na meko
Sɛ meyɛ aa na mewu aa na meko
Sɛ meyɛ aa na mewu aa na meko
Sɛ meyɛ aa na mewu aa na meko
Sɛ meyɛ aa na mewu aa na meko (na meko)
Sɛ meyɛ aa na mewu aa na meko
Sɛ meyɛ aa na mewu aa na meko
Sɛ meyɛ aa na mewu aa na meko
Sɛ meyɛ aa na mewu aa na meko
Sɛ meyɛ aa na mewu aa na me-
Na me- na meko
Trap, trapping my way up
Kwaku Rasta eh
Trapping my, ay
Trap, trapping my way up
