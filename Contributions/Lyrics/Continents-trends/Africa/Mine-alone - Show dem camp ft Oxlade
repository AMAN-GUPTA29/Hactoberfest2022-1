Verse 1: Ghost
Shey you say a bad man was never too good at algebra but our first date just broke the X
When I took your number when we crack the formular, a reasons why you should replace my ex
Now you got the boy tripping, retrace my steps
Quick SWOT analysis, let’s weigh up strength
Time to risk it all girl, I’ll place my bet that you check every box just like my favorite crepes
Let’s see, you’re soft spoken and your heart’s golden
The way your arch’s poking baby lord knows that I can slow stroke the weight off your shoulders
Love the way you super soak it, osmosis
I caught the bug and no, it’s not COVID
