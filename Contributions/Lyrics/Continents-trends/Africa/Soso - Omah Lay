Song by Omah Lay

Lyrics


Soso take my pain away
Soso take my pain
Soso take my pain away
Soso take my pain (pain, pain, pain)
Soso take my pain away (take my pain)
Soso take my pain away
(Please, come take my pain away)
Soso take my pain away
Soso take my pain
Ahn, ahn
All of the things them talk, I no dey hear, hear
Try wetin I do if you no dey fear, fear
One mind dey tell me to disappear, 'pear
Soso come and help me oh 'cause I don pray
Maami, I don break commandment
I can't stay for one place
For God sake, oh my dear
Come take my pain away from me oh
Soso take my pain away (take-take, take, take-take)
Soso take my pain (please, come take my pains away)
Soso take my pain away (so-so-so)
Soso take my pain
Shibiri, shibiri, shibiri uh
They are talkin' s-, shibiri
Water no get enemy
'Til you fall for Oshimiri
I poto poto my eyes
Ten shots
High rise
Touch God
I cry
Offshore
Cut my dreadlocks
Girlie, me, I don cry
Maami, I don break commandment
I can't stay for one place
For God sake, oh my dear
Come and ginger me
Only you dey feel my pains
Give me vitamins wey go take these pains away
Soso ohh, soso, soso ohh
Soso take my pain away (take-take, take, take-take)
Soso take my pain (please, come take my pains away)
Soso take my pain away (so, so, so-so)
Soso take my pain away (take my pain)
Soso take my pain away (take my pain away)
Soso take my pain
Soso take my pain away
Soso take my pain
