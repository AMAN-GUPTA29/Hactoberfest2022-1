Ayra Starr Lyrics

"Rush"

Vibez
Pa pa ri, pi pa pa ri pa
Pa pa ri, pi pa pa ri pa
Pa pa ri, pa

Sabi girls no dey too like talk
Animals dey in human form
Padi man, nobody like work
But you must hustle of you wan chop
E no finish dem wan fight us
If them dey run dem no fit catch up
I no dey form say I too righteous
No come dey form say you too like us

Me no get time for the hate and the bad energy
Got my mind on my money
Make you dance like Poco Lee
Steady green like broccoli
Steady on my grind no wan hear what they wan telly me
Kudi na my fantasy
Dem wan dey check if my tap e no rush

But e dey rush
E dey rush well well
E be much
Na God dey make my tap, e dey rush
The kind money we touch
But e dey rush
E dey rush well well
E be much
No be hype, everybody dey crush
There's no dulling with us (There's no dulling with us)

Pa pa ri, pi pa pa ri pa
Pa pa ri, pi pa pa ri pa
Pa pa ri, pa ri pa pa ri

Jofunmi Japata, I dey go ghana
You never touch, you dey form papas
Which kind money we never see before
Kosi elomi, gat me feeling I'm the one
Aje, aje, aje, can never take my cake away, aje
You can't count my grace
I just dey my lane, my lane

Me no getty time for the hate and the bad energy
Gat my mind on my money
Make you dance like poco lee
Steady green like broccoli
Steady on my grind no wan hear what they want telly me
Kudi na my fantasy
Dem won dey check if my tap e no rush

But e dey rush
E dey rush well well, e be much
Na God dey make my tap, e dey rush
The kind money we touch
Edey rush
E dey rush well well, e be much
No be hype everybody dey crush
There's no dulling with us (There's no dulling with us)

'Cause e dey rush
E dey rush well well
E be much
Na God dey make my tap, e dey rush
The kind money we touch
E dey rush
E dey rush well well, e be much
No be hype everybody dey crush
There's no dulling with us (There's no dulling)
