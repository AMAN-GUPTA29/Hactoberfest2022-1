Electricity (Mixed)
Song by Davido and Pheelz

Lyrics


E file fun RII boy
Baddest
Rii
Electricity
Vibes on a frequency, ah
'Til infinity (oh no)
Steady on a different p
Life is not that deep
It's all about the energy, ah
Na mentality (ooh)
Na him make a man worthy
Nobody go co-sign (shekpe)
And you know everything I do is
Nobody else concern
Ahh ah e, ah, hey
Shey you go come online
And I see darkness all around me
But I know I'm the light (but I know I'm the light)
Ahh ah e, ah, hey
Shake it (shake it)
Shake it, baby
Shake it (shake it)
I feel your vibration ('bration)
Fine girl omo toh Shan (toh Shan)
Beautiful temptation ('tation)
Bad girl on rotation ('tation)
Shake it (shake it)
Shake it (shake it)
Shake it, baby, shake it (shake it)
Oh, tonight
Electricity (gi' dem)
Vibes on a frequency, ah
'Til infinity (oh no)
Steady on a different p
Love is very sweet
But first you must get the mula
Na poverty
Na him make a man worry
Nobody go co-sign (shekpe)
And you know everything I do is
Nobody else concern
Ahh ah e, ah, hey
Shey you go come online (shey you go come online)
And I see darkness all around me
But I know I'm the light
Ahh ah e, ah, hey
Shake it (shake it)
Shake it, baby
Shake it (shake it)
I feel your vibration ('bration)
Fine girl omo toh Shan (toh Shan)
Beautiful temptation ('tation)
Bad girl on rotation ('tation)
Shake it (shake it)
Shake it (shake it)
Shake it, baby, shake it (shake it)
Oh, tonight
Electricity (shekpe)
Vibes on a frequency, ah
Ko Sope RII, Ridimakoolayo
Baddest
'Til infinity
Steady on a different p
(Steady on a different p)
Ohh, oh (Ridimakoolayo)
